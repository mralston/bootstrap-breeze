## Introduction

Breeze provides a minimal and simple starting point for building a Laravel application with authentication. Breeze publishes authentication controllers and views to your application that can be easily customized based on your own application's needs.

Bootstrap Breeze is powered by Inertia, Vue and Bootstrap. If you're looking for a more robust Laravel starter kit that includes two factor authentication, Livewire / Inertia support, and more, check out [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com).

This package is based on [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) ([laravel/breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze)) by Taylor Otwell.

Getting started couldn't be easier:

```bash
laravel new my-app

cd my-app

composer require mralston/bootstrap-breeze --dev

php artisan breeze:install vue-bootstrap
```
